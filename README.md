This session will cover some basic principles of teaching R, and introduce you to some useful tools. We will discuss how to plan the scope of a lesson, design effective teaching materials using RMarkdown, and develop practice problems to increase engagement.

Make sure you have [installed R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version 3.7+) [and RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (version 1.4+). Pre-install the following packages to ensure a smooth session: `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `gapminder`, `coefplot` .

All workshop materials are included in this repository. Download the repository to your computer and open the Rproject file to follow along.
