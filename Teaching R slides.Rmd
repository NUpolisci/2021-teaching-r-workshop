## Warm up

Let's do some polling! Go to [pollev.com/kumarr436](pollev.com/kumarr436)

## Learning objectives for today

1.   Construct a lesson plan for an R workshop/session
2.   Understand the examples-and-exercises approach to teaching R
3.   Articulate questions about how to teach R workshops/sessions
4.   Identify resources to address those questions

## Outline

# Preparing to teach

## Why learn to teach R?

> -   Teaching is the best way to learn 🤓
> -   Lots of opportunities to teach R at Northwestern 💸
> -   Build your teaching portfolio 🗂 
> -   Good training for certain non-academic career paths 👩‍💻

## Questions to ask yourself

> -   What are your **learning objectives** for the course/session/workshop?
> -   What are the opportunities and constraints you'll have in your **teaching environment**?
> -   How much **background** do your students have? How much do they need?

## Learning objectives

> -   Much of this will be determined by context: the students may need specific skills (e.g. regression, data viz) for a class, you may be teaching general-purpose skills for data analysis, etc. 
> -   I believe every R workshop should share these learning objectives: **Articulate questions about the [technique/method taught]** and **Identify resources to address those questions**.
> -   In simpler language: you want students to walk away knowing how to ask for help when they run into problems.

## Teaching environment

> -   One-off workshop vs. series
> -   Virtual vs. in-person
> -   Solo teaching vs. group teaching

# Determining the scope of your lesson

## Background knowledge

[what do your students know?]
[how to handle students having different levels of background knowledge?]
[where to get background knowledge? pre-lesson videos, dataquest, learnr tutorials]

## Do you need to cover the basics?

> -   Installing R and RStudio
> -   Navigating RStudio
> -   "code", "comments", "objects"
> -   Syntax
> -   Data types and structures

# Building your lesson

## Befriend RMarkdown (and RPojects)

## Storing and sharing the materials

## RStudio Cloud

## Pre-workshop assignments?

# Structuring your lesson

## Where to start

## Helping your students feel comfortable

## Core content

I strongly suggest an **examples and exercises** approach to teaching skills in R. We'll practice this in a moment. 

## Building flexibility into your lesson

## Ending with encouragement

# Examples and Exercises

## Learning by doing

# Lesson snippets

## Lesson snippet 1: ggplot, step by step

[grammar of graphics] [introduce very basic plot] [add geoms] [exercise - repeat task with different variables] [add a line with the mean] [grouping: group by colors] [exercise - repeat task with different variables, include a bonus] [summative exercise!]

## Lesson snippet 2: working with dates

[read a file with vaccine data, look at the readr output vs. read.csv output]
[manipulate dates]
[make a histogram by date vs by month]

## Lesson snippet 3: regression and coefplot
