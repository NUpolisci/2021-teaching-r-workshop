## Warm up

Let's do some polling! Go to [pollev.com/kumarr436](http://pollev.com/kumarr436)

## Learning objectives for today

1.  Construct a lesson plan for an R workshop/session
2.  Understand the examples-and-exercises approach to teaching R
3.  Articulate questions about how to teach R workshops/sessions
4.  Identify resources to address those questions

## Outline

-   Preparing to teach
-   Determining the scope of your lesson
-   Building your lesson (nuts-and-bolts)
-   Structuring your lesson (what goes after what?)
-   Examples and Exercises
-   Practice lesson snippets

# Preparing to teach

## Why should you learn to teach R?

> -   Teaching is the best way to learn 🤓
> -   Lots of opportunities to teach R workshops/etc at Northwestern 💸
> -   Build your teaching portfolio 🗂
> -   Training for certain non-academic career paths 👩‍💻

## Questions to ask yourself

> -   What are your **learning objectives** for the course/session/workshop?
> -   What are the opportunities and constraints you'll have in your **teaching environment**?
> -   How much **background** do your students have? How much do they need?

## Learning objectives

> -   Much of this will be determined by context: the students may need specific skills (e.g. regression, data viz) for a class, you may be teaching general-purpose skills for data analysis, etc.
> -   I believe every R workshop should share these learning objectives: **Articulate questions about the [technique/method taught]** and **Identify resources to address those questions**.
> -   In simpler language: you want students to walk away knowing how to ask for help when they run into problems.

## Teaching environment

> -   One-off workshop vs. series
> -   Virtual vs. in-person
> -   Solo teaching vs. group teaching

# Determining the scope of your lesson

## Background knowledge

-   What do the students already know? You may be able to answer this from program structure, or through a survey.
-   Sometimes students will be coming in with different levels of background knowledge. You can try to address this before the session and/or adjust your teaching accordingly. 
-   Where can students get background knowledge before the session?
    -   Pre-session videos
    -   DataQuest
    -   `learnr` tutorials

## Do you need to cover the basics? What *are* the basics?

> -   Installing R and RStudio
> -   Navigating RStudio
> -   "code", "comments", "objects"
> -   Syntax and data types
> -   Data structures
> -   Reading and writing files

# Building your lesson

## Building your lesson

> -   Befriend `RMarkdown` (and `RProjects`)
> -   Consider how to store and share materials: Github, Box folder, something else, none of the above
> -   Other types of tools: RStudio Cloud
> -   Connect to other course materials, pre-workshop assignments, etc.

# Structuring your lesson

## Where to start

Motivation 

-   Use the end point as motivation: show them what they will learn! 
-   Pick some real data that the students are likely to be interested in 

Help students feel comfortable

-   Remind them that they are learning a skill, which only comes with practice
-   Encourage your students to learn from *each other*

## Core content

I usually outline the core content by:

1.  Create the end products and break down each step.
2.  Look up existing teaching materials on the same/related topic.

I strongly suggest an **examples and exercises** approach to teaching skills in R. We'll practice this in a moment.

## Building flexibility into your lesson

-   Plan for a little bit more material than you can teach
-   Provide data files that students can play around with
-   For complex skills, give yourself wiggle room to skip over exercises based on timing/interest

## Ending with encouragement

I always like to end with: 

1.  Main takeaways
2.  Resources
3.  Reminder that they've just learned to create things! 

# Examples and Exercises

## Learning by doing

```{r out.width="45%"}
meme_get("TwoButtonsAnxiety") %>% 
    meme_text_buttons("Listen to the instructor", "Take notes", size=18)
```

## Learning by doing

Open the RProject file and look in the working directory: you will see an `exercises` subdirectory and an `answers` subdirectory. 

The following lesson snippets all use `.R` code files for the exercises. You can also ask students to use `.Rmd`, especially if this is part of a course where you will need to collect assignment submissions. 

# Lesson snippets

# Lesson snippet 1: ggplot and the grammar of graphics

## [under construction -- answers/exercise1_answers.R shows what will be covered]

# Lesson snippet 2: working with dates

## [under construction -- answers/exercise2_answers.R shows what will be covered]

# Lesson snippet 3: regression and coefplot

## [under construction -- answers/exercise1_answers.R shows what will be covered]

# Wrapping up

## Takeaways

1.  Lesson planning is really important: Develop learning objectives. Assess what your students already know + what they need. 
2.  Use the tools that R provides: `RMarkdown`, `RProjects`, and `RStudio` itself.
3.  Construct your lessons around examples and exercises, so that students practice writing code *during* the session.
4.  Lean on the broad community of R users and social scientists. You almost never have to start from scratch.
